# Week 1 (November 9 - 15, 2025)

## Summary

The primary focus for this week is the preparation of a foundational document that outlines key concepts relevant to the project. This includes an exploration of type inferencing, various type systems, and the challenges associated with dynamically typed languages. Additionally, efforts were made to establish a well-organized repository structure to facilitate future research and development activities.

---

## Goals Set for This Week
- Produce a document that covers fundamental concepts incorporated in the project (type inferencing, popular type systems, disadvantages of dynamically typed languages) that will serve as the foundational literature review.
- Establish a repository file structure.

---

## Detailed Work Completed

- Research and wrote about Hindley-Milner (HM) typing rules, principal types, let-polymorphism, and the applicability of HM to functional languages.
- Analyzed the limitations of HM when applied to dynamic languages, focusing on mutation, dynamic tables, and ad-hoc polymorphism.
- Reviewed and summarized related work on Typed Luau, Luau, Teal, TypeScript, Sorbet, and Flow, highlighting their approaches to typing and their relevance to the project.
- Completed an initial draft of the foundations-brief
- Organized GitHub Repository to optimize for research

---

## Plan for Next Week

- Begin review of rough draft of foundations-brief
- Complete revisions based on necessary changes for foundations-brief
- Outline initial grammar and type system for MiniLua

---

## Time Spent
- Research and Writing: 15 hours
- Repository Organization: 0.5 hours
- Total: 15.5 hours

## Reflection

This week was productive in laying the groundwork for the project. The research into type systems and their limitations in dynamically typed languages provided valuable insights that will inform future development. The organization of the repository will also facilitate smoother collaboration and documentation as the project progresses. Moving forward, the focus will shift towards refining the foundational document and beginning to outline the specifics of MiniLua's grammar and type system. This foundational work is crucial for the success of the project, but more-so for the hopes of seeking faculty mentorship and guidance as the project continues.
