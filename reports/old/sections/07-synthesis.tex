\section{Final Synthesis}
This literature review of existing work on type inference systems for Lua-like languages has validated the "MiniLua" project in its goal to implement a pure type inference system based on the Hindley-Milner type system. The review has highlighted the challenges and trade-offs involved in designing type inference systems for dynamically typed languages, particularly in the context of Lua's dynamic features and imperative programming paradigm. By analyzing various approaches, including Typed Lua, Luau, and Teal, the review has identified common limitations and compromises made in existing systems, such as reliance on annotations, limited type inference capabilities, and trade-offs between soundness and usability.
